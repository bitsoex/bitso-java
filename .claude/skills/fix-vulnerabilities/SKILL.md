# Fix Vulnerabilities

Fix Dependabot security vulnerabilities in Java/Gradle projects with proper verification.

## When to use this skill

- Resolving Dependabot security alerts
- Fixing CVE vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Verifying dependency graph for CI compliance
- Choosing the right fix strategy for transitive dependencies
- Understanding why `dependency-review` CI check fails
- When asked to "fix dependabot vulnerabilities" or "fix security alerts"

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Jira ticket first

See `global/rules/jira-ticket-workflow.md` for ticket creation.

### 2. Get alerts by severity

```bash
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q '.nameWithOwner')
gh api --paginate repos/$REPO/dependabot/alerts --jq '.[] | select(.state == "open") | {
  number, severity: .security_advisory.severity, package: .dependency.package.name,
  patched_version: .security_vulnerability.first_patched_version.identifier,
  cve: .security_advisory.cve_id
}'
```

### 3. Fix by severity (CRITICAL first, then HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)

See [references/fix-strategies.md](references/fix-strategies.md) for strategy hierarchy.

### 4. Verify with dependency graph

```bash
./gradlew -I gradle/dependency-graph-init.gradle \
    --dependency-verification=off \
    :ForceDependencyResolutionPlugin_resolveAllDependencies

# Check ONLY patched versions appear
grep -i "package-name" build/reports/dependency-graph-snapshots/dependency-list.txt
```

### 5. Commit and create PR

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```bash
git commit -m "fix(security): [JIRA-KEY] resolve CRITICAL vulnerabilities

Generated with the Quality Agent by the /fix-vulnerabilities command."
```

## Key Concepts

### Severity-Based Processing

Process ONE severity level at a time, creating separate PRs for each:

| Priority | Severity | When to Process |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | CRITICAL | Always first |
| 2 | HIGH | After no CRITICAL |
| 3 | MEDIUM | After no HIGH |
| 4 | LOW | After no MEDIUM |

### Dependency Graph vs Runtime Resolution

The dependency graph plugin reports ALL versions to GitHub, not just the resolved version.
Force rules alone won't fix `dependency-review` failures - use substitution to remove old versions.

### Fix Strategy Hierarchy

1. **BOM Update** - Update Spring Boot, gRPC, Protobuf BOM versions
1b. **BOM Property Override** - Override a BOM-managed version property (e.g., `ext['jackson-bom.version']`) when upgrading the entire BOM isn't feasible (requires `io.spring.dependency-management` plugin)
2. **Version Catalog** - Update direct dependencies in `libs.versions.toml`
3. **Dependency Substitution** - Replace transitive dependencies
4. **Constraints** - Set minimum version floors
5. **Force Rules** - Quick fix (combine with substitution)
6. **Exclude + Add** - Last resort
