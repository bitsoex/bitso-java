#     "**/templates/*.md",   # Don't publish templates
# ]

# ============================================================================
# Optional: Custom macros
# ============================================================================
# For advanced Confluence integration, you can define custom macros:
#
# [[macro]]
# name = "anchor"
# pattern = "<!--:anchor::(\\w+)::-->"
# template = "ac:anchor"
# anchor = "${1}"
# AUTO-GENERATED FILE - DO NOT EDIT DIRECTLY
