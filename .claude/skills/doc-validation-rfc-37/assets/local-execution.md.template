# Local Execution

This document provides step-by-step instructions for running [SERVICE_NAME] locally on your development machine. Whether you're using it for local development or contributing to the project, this guide will get you up and running quickly.

## Installation Options

There are multiple ways to run [SERVICE_NAME] locally:

1. **[Primary Method]** - Easiest for end users
2. **Docker** - Cross-platform, containerized execution
3. **Dev Container** - Full development environment for contributors

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

### Required Software

- **[Language Runtime]** (version X+): `[version-check-command]`
- **[Build Tool]** (version X+): `[version-check-command]`
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**: `docker --version`

### Additional Requirements

- **AWS CLI** configured (if applicable): `aws sts get-caller-identity`
- **[Other tools]**: Description

## Option 1: [Primary Method] Installation

### Installation Steps

1. **[Step 1 description]**:

   ```bash
   # Command for step 1
   ```

2. **[Step 2 description]**:

   ```bash
   # Command for step 2
   ```

3. **Verify installation**:

   ```bash
   # Verification command
   ```

### Usage

Once installed, you can run:

```bash
# Basic usage
[command] [options]

# With verbose output
[command] --verbose

# Get help
[command] --help
```

## Option 2: Docker

Run using Docker without installing locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** installed and running
- **Access credentials** (if using private registry)

### Pulling the Image

```bash
# Login to registry (if needed)
echo $TOKEN | docker login [registry] -u USERNAME --password-stdin

# Pull the image
docker pull [registry]/[image]:latest
```

### Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace [image]:latest [args]

# With environment variables
docker run --rm -e VAR=value -v $(pwd):/workspace [image]:latest [args]
```

## Option 3: Dev Container (For Development)

For contributors who want to modify the code or contribute to the project.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** - Download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- **VS Code** or **Cursor** with Dev Containers extension

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:bitsoex/[REPO_NAME].git
   cd [REPO_NAME]
   ```

2. **Open in VS Code** and run the Dev Container:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)
   - Type and select: **"Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"**
   - Wait for the container to build (first time may take 5-10 minutes)

### What's Included

The Dev Container comes pre-configured with:

- [Language runtime and tools]
- [Build tools]
- [Linters and formatters]
- [Testing frameworks]
- Pre-commit hooks configured

## Environment Setup

### Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and customize it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required variables:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `[VAR_1]` | [Description] | `[example-value]` |
| `[VAR_2]` | [Description] | `[example-value]` |

### Start Dependencies

Start required services using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts:

- [Service 1] (port XXXX)
- [Service 2] (port XXXX)

Verify services are running:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

## Build the Application

### Using [Build Tool]

```bash
# Clean build with tests
[build-command]

# Quick build (skip tests)
[build-command-skip-tests]
```

### Using Make (if available)

```bash
make build
```

## Run the Application

### Option 1: [Build Tool]

```bash
[run-command]
```

### Option 2: Direct Execution

```bash
[direct-run-command]
```

### Option 3: IDE

1. Open the project in your IDE
2. Navigate to the main entry point
3. Run the application

The service should start on port [PORT] (or configured port).

## Verify the Setup

### Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:[PORT]/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "status": "UP"
}
```

### API Documentation (if applicable)

Open in your browser:

```text
http://localhost:[PORT]/swagger-ui.html
```

## Testing the Happy Path

### Feature 1: [FEATURE_NAME]

1. **Step 1**: [Description]

   ```bash
   # Command or API call
   ```

2. **Step 2**: [Description]

   ```bash
   # Command or API call
   ```

3. **Verify**: [What to check to confirm success]

### Feature 2: [FEATURE_NAME]

[Repeat the pattern above for each major feature]

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests

```bash
[test-command]
```

### Integration Tests

```bash
[integration-test-command]
```

### All Tests with Coverage

```bash
[coverage-command]
```

Coverage report location: `[path-to-coverage-report]`

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Run linter
[lint-command]

# Auto-fix issues
[lint-fix-command]

# Format code
[format-command]
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

If using pre-commit hooks:

```bash
# Install hooks
pre-commit install

# Run manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Port Already in Use

```bash
# Find process using port
lsof -i :[PORT]

# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>
```

#### [Service] Connection Failed

1. Verify Docker containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
2. Check logs: `docker-compose logs [service]`
3. Verify environment variables in `.env`

#### [Credentials] Error

```bash
# Verify credentials
[verify-command]

# Refresh if expired
[refresh-command]
```

### Debug Mode

For detailed output:

```bash
[command] --log-level debug --verbose
```

### Getting Help

- **Slack**: #[TEAM_CHANNEL]
- **On-call**: Check PagerDuty schedule
- **Documentation**: [Link to additional docs]

## Cleanup

Stop all local services:

```bash
docker-compose down

# Remove volumes (clears data)
docker-compose down -v
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have the application running locally:

1. **Explore the codebase**: Review key directories
2. **Run the development workflow**: `make dev` or equivalent
3. **Create your first change**: Follow the contributing guide
4. **Review other documentation**: Check `docs/` for more guides
