# Mutation Testing

Use PIT mutation testing to identify tests that pass but don't verify behavior correctly.

## When to use this skill

- Improving test quality beyond line coverage metrics
- Finding weak test assertions that don't catch bugs
- Validating critical business logic has strong tests
- Setting up mutation testing in CI pipelines
- Analyzing which tests need strengthening
- When asked to "improve test quality with mutation testing"

## Quick Start

### 1. Check readiness

```bash
bash java/scripts/check-pitest-readiness.sh
```

### 2. Apply PIT configuration

Copy `java/templates/pitest.gradle` to `gradle/pitest.gradle` and apply in `build.gradle`.

### 3. Run mutation testing

```bash
# QUICK level - fast feedback
./gradlew pitest -Ppitest.mutators=DEFAULTS

# STANDARD level - recommended
./gradlew pitest -Ppitest.mutators=STRONGER

# COMPREHENSIVE level - thorough
./gradlew pitest -Ppitest.mutators=ALL
```

### 4. Analyze results

```bash
open build/reports/pitest/index.html
```

Focus on **SURVIVED** mutants - these indicate weak tests.

### 5. Improve tests

Add specific assertions that kill the surviving mutants.

## Key Concepts

### Mutation Score vs Line Coverage

- **Line coverage**: Does your test execute the code?
- **Mutation score**: Does your test actually verify the code works correctly?

High line coverage with low mutation score = tests run code but don't verify results.

### Intensity Levels

| Level | Mutators | Use Case | Time |
|-------|----------|----------|------|
| QUICK | DEFAULTS (~11) | Initial analysis, CI | 1x |
| STANDARD | STRONGER (~14) | Regular improvement | 1.5x |
| COMPREHENSIVE | ALL (~30+) | Critical logic | 3-5x |

### Mutation Statuses

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Killed | Test detected mutation | Good |
| Survived | Test missed mutation | Improve test |
| No Coverage | No test covers code | Write test |
| Timed Out | Infinite loop | Usually OK |
