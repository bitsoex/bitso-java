| `feat` | New features |

| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change |

## Format Rules

1. **Use conventional commit format** - `type(scope): description`
2. **Include Jira key when applicable** - In brackets: `[PROJ-123]`
3. **Add attribution footer** - For commands that have specific agents
4. **Add co-author for CodeRabbit** - When fixing CodeRabbit issues
5. **Keep subject line concise** - Under 72 characters
6. **Use bullet points for details** - Makes changes scannable
