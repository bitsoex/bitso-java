# General AI Coding Principles

These principles apply to all repositories regardless of technology stack.

## Quick Reference

### Code Quality

- Write self-documenting code with clear names
- Security first: never hardcode secrets
- Optimize for readability first, performance second
- Fail fast with meaningful error messages

### Development Practices

- Never downgrade pre-existing dependency versions
- Make atomic commits with descriptive messages
