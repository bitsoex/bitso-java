# Never work directly on main. Always verify your branch and create a new one if needed before making changes.

**Rule**: Never commit directly to `main`. All work must happen on a feature/fix/chore branch.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Fetch latest
git fetch --all

# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# If on main, create feature branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
