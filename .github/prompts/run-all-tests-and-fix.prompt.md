# Run All Tests and Fix Failures

## Overview

Execute the full test suite and systematically fix any failures, ensuring code quality and functionality.

## Steps

### Run test suite

- Execute all tests in the project
- Capture output and identify failures
- Check both unit and integration tests

### Analyze failures

- Categorize by type: flaky, broken, new failures
- Prioritize fixes based on impact
- Check if failures are related to recent changes

### Fix issues systematically

- Start with the most critical failures
- Fix one issue at a time
- Re-run tests after each fix
